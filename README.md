# Loan Eligibility Prediction
A personal classification project to predict loan eligibility using Python machine learning based on a dataset containing information on customers' past transactions. I will attempt to follow instructions to deploy the resulting model as an active app using Streamlit.
# Project Inspiration:
The idea for this project came from a Blog post by [Jonathan Okah](https://blog.finxter.com/author/jonathanokah23424/) called "[How I Built and Deployed a Python Loan Eligibility Prediction App on Streamlit](https://blog.finxter.com/how-i-built-and-deployed-a-python-loan-eligibility-prediction-app-on-streamlit/?tl_inbound=1&tl_target_all=1&tl_form_type=1&tl_period_type=3&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=project_python_loan_eligibility_prediction_app_on_streamlit&utm_term=2023-02-04)" posted on [Finxster](https://blog.finxter.com/finxter-mission/). 

I chose it for a couple reasons:
  1. It looked like it would be a fairly easy to replicate project for practice straight out of the gate after graduating my [Codeup](https://codeup.com/program/data-science/) Data Science course. 
  2. I am getting ready to begin my house buying search and thought it my be helpful to my endevours.
  3. I was very interested in the aspect of deploying the model as a functioning app using [Streamlit](https://jonaben1-loan-predicition-app-bnti80.streamlit.app/).

I'm hoping to add additional criteria features to the program such as Debt to Income Ratio, Percent Credit Card Debt, etc... to be more accurate and realistic in line with the requirements of a mortgage lender. These are the unseen factors of the data that are not recorded but had to be met in order to even be eligible for a loan in the first place.

Optionally as an extension to this project, I have found an SQL dataset in the Codeup database named home_credit that has over 300k historical loan records and an additional 48.7k applications.
